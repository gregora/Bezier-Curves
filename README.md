## How do I add it to my project?

Everything you need is in `bezier.cpp` and `bezier.h` files.

In `bezier.cpp` is a single function that returns an array of vertices (with a given resolution), so you can render your bezeier curve.

The array looks like this:

`{x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn}`

## Demo

Demo requires you to install SFML library.
You can then run it using `compile.sh` file.
